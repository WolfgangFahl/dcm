      Software architects are responsible for meeting requirements and creating the architecture design of a solution.
      Depending on the actual approach or process model used, they must align this responsibility with the overall responsibilities of project management and/or other roles.

      Tasks and responsibilities of software architects:

      * clarify and scrutinize requirements and constraints, and refine them if necessary,
        including _required features_ and _required constraints_
      * decide how to decompose the system into building blocks, while determining dependencies and interfaces between the building blocks
      * determine and decide on cross-cutting concepts (for instance persistence, communication, GUI etc.)
      * communicate and document software architecture based on views, architectural patterns, cross-cutting and technical concepts
      * accompany the realization and implementation of the architecture; integrate feedback from relevant stakeholders into the architecture if necessary; review and ensure the consistency of source code and software architecture
      * analyze and evaluate software architecture, especially with respect to risks that involve meeting the requirements, see <<LG-4-3>> and <<LG-4-4>>,
      * identify, highlight, and justify the consequences of architectural decisions to other stakeholders

      They should independently recognize the necessity of iterations in all tasks and point out possibilities for appropriate and relevant feedback.

      Software architects know:

      * various architectural patterns and can apply them when appropriate
      * that patterns are a way to achieve certain qualities for given problems and requirements within given contexts
      * that various categories of patterns exist (R3)
      * additional sources for patterns related to their specific technical or application domain (R3)


      Software architects can explain and provide examples for the following patterns (R1):

      * _layers_:
      ** abstraction layers hide details, example: ISO/OSI network layers, or "hardware abstraction layer". See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_abstraction
      ** another interpretation are Layers to (physically) separate functionality or responsibility, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture

      * _pipes and filters_: representative for data flow patterns, breaking down stepwise processing into a series of processing-activities ("Filters") and associated data transport/buffering capabilities ("Pipes").
      * _microservices_ split applications into separate executables that communicate via a network
      * _dependency injection_ as a possible solution for the Dependency-Inversion-Principle <<newman>>


      Software architects can explain several of the following patterns, explain their relevance for concrete systems, and provide examples. (R3)

      * _blackboard_: handle problems that cannot be solved by deterministic algorithms but require diverse knowledge
      * _broker_:  responsible for coordinating communication between provider(s) and consumer(s), applied in distributed systems. Responsible for forwarding requests and/or transmitting results and exceptions
      * _combinator_ (synonym: closure of operations), for domain object of type T, look for operations with both input and output type T. See <<yorgey>>
      * _CQRS_ (Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation): separates read from write concerns in information systems. Requires some context on database-/persistence technology to understand the different properties and requirements of "read" versus "write" operations
      * _event sourcing_:  handle operations on data by a sequence of events, each of which is recorded in an append-only store
      * _interpreter_: represent domain object or DSL as syntax, provide function implementing a semantic interpretation of domain object separately from domain object itself
      * integration and messaging patterns (e.g. from <<hohpe>>)
      * the MVC (Model View Controller), MVVM (Model View ViewModel), MVU (Model View Update), PAC (Presentation Abstraction Control) family of patterns, separating external representation (view) from data, services and their coordination
      * interfacing patterns like Adapter, Facade, Proxy. Such patterns help in integration of subsystems and/or simplification of dependencies. Architects should know that these patterns can be used independent of (object) technology
      ** _adapter_: decouple consumer and provider - where the interface of the provider does not exactly match that of the consumer. The Adapter decouples one party from interface-changes in the other
      ** _facade_: simplifies usage of a provider for consumer(s) by providing simplified access
      ** _proxy_: an intermediate between consumer and provider, enabling temporal decoupling, caching of results, controlling access to the provider etc.
      * _observer_: An interested object (observer) registers with another
        object (the subject) so that the subject notifies the observer upon changes.
      * _plug-in_: extend the behaviour of a component
      * _ports & adapters_ (syn. Onion-Architecture, Hexagonal-Architecture, Clean-Architecture): concentrate domain logic in the center of the system, have connections to the outside world (database, UI) at the edges, dependencies only outside-in, never inside-out <<lange21>> <<martin17>>
      * _remote procedure call_: make a function or algorithm execute in a different address space
      * _SOA_ (Service-Oriented Architecture): an approach to provide abstract services rather than concrete implementations to users of the system to promote reuse of services across departments and between companies
      * _template and strategy_: make specific algorithms flexible by encapsulating them
      * _visitor_: separate data-structure traversal from specific processing

      Software architects know essential sources for architectural patterns, such as POSA (e.g. <<buschmanna>>) and PoEAA (<<fowler>>) (for information systems) (R3).

      **Simplicity** (R1-R2)

      * as a means to reduce complexity (R1)

      * basics of several published frameworks for the description of software architectures, for example:
      ** ISO/IEEE-42010 (formerly 1471), see <<iso42010>>
      ** arc42, see <<arc42>>
      ** C4, see <<brownc4>>
      ** FMC, see <<fmc>>
      * ideas and examples of checklists for the creation, documentation, and testing of software architectures
      * possible tools for creating and maintaining architectural documentation

      Software architects can explain:

      * the concept of quality and quality characteristics  (based on e.g. <<iso25010>> or <<bass>>)
      * generic quality models (such as <<iso25010>>, <<bass>>, or <<q42>>)
      * correlations and trade-offs of quality characteristics, for example:
      ** configurability versus reliability
      ** memory requirements versus performance efficiency
      ** security versus usability
      ** runtime flexibility versus maintainability.

      Software architects:

      * know methodical approaches for the qualitative analysis of software architectures (R2), for example, as specified by ATAM (R3);
      * can qualitatively analyze smaller systems (R2)
      * know that the following sources of information can help in the qualitative analysis of architectures (R2):
      ** quality requirements, e.g. in the form of quality trees and scenarios
      ** architecture documentation
      ** architecture and design models
      ** source code
      ** metrics
      ** other documentation of the system, such as requirements, operational or test documentation.

  - name: Quantitative Evaluation of Software Architectures (R2)
    short_name: LG4-4
    id: 4-04
    description: |2+


      Software architects know approaches for the quantitative analysis and evaluation (measurement) of software.

      They know that:

      * quantitative evaluation can help to identify critical parts within systems
      * further information can be helpful for the evaluation of architectures, for example:
      ** requirements and architecture documentation
      ** source code and related metrics such as lines of code, (cyclomatic) complexity, inbound and outbound dependencies
      ** known errors in source code, especially error clusters
      ** test cases and test results.
      * the use of a metric as a target can lead to its invalidation (R2), as described, e.g., by Goodhart's law (R3).
